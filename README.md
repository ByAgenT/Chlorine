# Chlorine

Chlorine is a party room application for Spotify. It helps you create rooms with your Spotify account and let other people connect to your room, add their own music into the party playlist.

> NOTE: This project was a part of my coursework. It has some design issues and missing functionality. This is also my first personal project in Go.
